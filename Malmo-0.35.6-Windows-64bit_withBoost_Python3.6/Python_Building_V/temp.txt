You have enough blocks in your hands. You can only do the following:
- "use" - place the block in front of you.
- "movenorth" - move one block north.
- "moveeast" - move one block east.
- "movesouth" - move one block south.
- "movewest" - move one block west.
- "attack" - destroy the block in front of you.

For example, to place a block in a small 'v' shape, you need to ['use'] directly in front, then for the upper right, use ['moveeast', 'movenorth', 'use'], then return with ['movesouth', 'movewest'], and for the upper left, use ['movewest', 'movenorth', 'use']. Thus, the final sequence of actions would be: 'build_v' = ['use', 'moveeast', 'movenorth', 'use', 'movesouth', 'movewest', 'movewest', 'movenorth', 'use'].

If you want to destroy the 'v' shape, you can do so by following the reverse order and opposite direction from the last position as follows: 'destroy_v' = ['attack', 'movesouth', 'moveeast', 'moveeast', 'movenorth', 'attack', 'movesouth', 'movewest', 'attack'].

Pay attention to the relationship between build_v and destroy_v. If you understand, answer 'Understood'.
